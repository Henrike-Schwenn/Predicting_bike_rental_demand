# Train Random Forest Regressor on dataframe trainingFirstCycle
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
import feather
# TODO Read feather formatted trainingFirstCycle and define as array X_train
    # This is the training set
# TODO Define X_train.rent_count as dependent variable Y_train
    # This is the dependent variable of the training set, the column to be predicted
# TODO Read feather formatted dfFirstCycle_validate and define as array X_validate
    # This is the name of the validation set
# TODO Read y_name_validation.csv and define as Y_validate
    # This is the dependent variable of the validation set, the column to be predicted
# TODO Run sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor()
# TODO Run fit method on training set
# TODO Run print_score function on training and validation sets
# TODO Return parameters
    # fastai.print_score() takes care of that
