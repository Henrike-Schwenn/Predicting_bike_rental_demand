## Predicting Bike Rental Demand

### Project Description

- **Title: Predicting Bike Rental Demand**
- **Kaggle Competition**
- [Bike Sharing Demand.Forecast use of a city bikeshare system](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand)
- Launched in 2014
- Why useful:
- > The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.
- **What it does**
