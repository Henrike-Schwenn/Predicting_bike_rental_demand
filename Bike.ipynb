    "This is my take on the Kaggle competition \"Bike Sharing Demand\", aiming to predict bike rental demand depending on the weather. The official description is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.\"\n",

  {

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Predict the total number of bikes rented per hour, within the context of climatic factors such as temperature and humidity. The calendar is also taken into account, that means datetime, season and whether it's a workday or a holiday.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of this predicition should be enhancing the service of the Capital Bikeshare program by adapting the number of provided bikes to said factors. By giving insights into the use of bycicles by the population of Washington D.C.,the results will also be useful regarding traffic, safety, health and climate issues regarding the city."
